    "In the past few years, data science is emerged as critical field having many applications in every fields like health,business etc.Due to the explosion of tools, technologies, and frameworks created to enable data science workflows, it is now simpler than ever to collect, examine, and derive insights from large-scale data sets. In this notebook, we'll give an overview of the numerous technologies and tools that make up the data science ecosystem, including well-known programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and other tools and resources that data scientists frequently use."
